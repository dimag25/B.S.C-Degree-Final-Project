Main Loop:

define VideoCapture and extract width, height and fps
define minFaceSize as 40% of the frame
create FrameHandler instance
load LBP Cascade XML for face detection

loop while ESC key has not been pressed and frame is not empty
	read frame from camera
	
	send snapshot to server every 60 seconds
	
	detectMultiScale - locate all faces and insert to discoveredFaces list
	
	if discoveredFaces.size >= knownFaces.size //same amount of faces or new faces
		for each knownFace 
			locate the closest face in discoveredFaces 
			process (see Face Processing below)
		for each discoveredFace in discoveredFaces that is not in knownFaces 
			create new face instance and add to knownFaces
			process (see Face Processing below)
			
	if discoveredFaces.size < knownFaces.size //lesser amount of faces
		set all knownFaces as unmatched
		
		for each discoveredFace in discoveredFaces
			match to closest unmatched knownFace
			set knownFace as matched
			process (see Face Processing below)
			
		remove all unmatched faces from knownFaces
		
	if there is no face with a valid heart rate 
		send alert to server
		run motion detection (see Motion Detection below)
	
Face Processing:
	update face size and position and re-adjust ROI position
	magnify ROI using Eulerian Video Magnification
	if signal is stable and not too noisy
		deternd and normalize the pulse signal
		apply mean filter to the pulse signal
		detect peaks base on the Pulse Onset Detection algorithm
		if pulse signal is valid
			estimate heart rate
	else reset all components
